# üèÄ NBA Teams Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project that analyzes NBA team statistics.  
The goal is to explore team performance across seasons and visualize key stats.  
This is done in the **`predstavitev_podatkov_v1.ipynb`** notebook.  

The other notebooks are helper files used to:
- Download the statistics from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)
- Process and clean the data so that it can be represented properly

## Contents
- **NBA_TEAMS/** ‚Äì contains data about all of the teams from 1990‚Äì2024  
  (for some teams the data is missing because they were not active that year)
- **web_scraping_v1_FAIL.ipynb** and **web_scraping_v2_FAIL.ipynb** ‚Äì  
  first two attempts to scrape data, failed because the website blocked requests after ~30 attempts
- **web_scraping_v3_SUCCESS.ipynb** ‚Äì final and successful scraping attempt  
  (downloads individual HTMLs, takes some time to run)
- **obdelava_html.ipynb** ‚Äì notebook for cleaning the HTML files, keeping only the required tables
- **vsi_podatki.pkl** ‚Äì main dataset used by `predstavitev_podatkov_v1.ipynb`
- **predstavitev_podatkov_v1.ipynb** ‚Äì **main notebook** where all visualization happens
